#  ParkWorkout SpecDoc

Welcome to ParkWorkout! I'm building this as a response to covid and the need for people to get some physical activity in. The way this app works is that a user will put their location in and parks or public places will appear. Based on the park, people can create a list of workouts and share the list to the community. Lists will be ranked based on stars from people who have used the workouts. Thw workout meta data will be a video, location, movement & purpose.
